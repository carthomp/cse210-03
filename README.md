The rules are simple. The jumper guesses letters,
one at a time. If the letter is not in the puzzle, the parachute loses a line.
Guessing continues until the puzzle is solved or, well, you know.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine.
Open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by
running the following command.
```
python3 jumper
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the folder and
click the "run" icon.
